    """Compute the daily frequency of occurrences
        for each feature in the given DataFrame.

    This function assumes that the input DataFrame contains a "date" column.
        The "date" column
    is converted to a datetime format and set as the index of a new DataFrame.
    Subsequently, each feature is resampled on a daily frequency,
    and the total count of occurrences is computed,
    generating a DataFrame representing the daily frequency of each feature.

    Args:
        data (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing
            features and a "date" column.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: A new DataFrame with the date set
            as the index and features resampled
            on a daily frequency, indicating the
            daily count of occurrences for each feature.
